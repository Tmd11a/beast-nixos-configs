# nixos-config-files
Public repo, while I use my private repo for changes to my NixOS server configuration. Switched from using Debian to NixOS for my media server, overall I like reproducibility of Nix, however there is a much stronger learning curve. 

Also the namesake of my server is from X-Men, Beast or Dr. Hank McCoy.
